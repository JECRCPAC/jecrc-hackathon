An engineer at heart, Kyle’s interest in self-driving technology can be traced back to his time at MIT. As an undergrad, he worked on the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, where he co-led a team to retrofit a truck to drive across the Nevada desert. Kyle’s entrepreneurial track record extends beyond Cruise - he also co-founded Twitch (acquired by Amazon), Socialcam (acquired by Autodesk), and Justin.tv - but his life passion is to deploy self-driving cars at scale in order to make automobile accidents a thing of the past. A native of Kansas City, he currently resides in San Francisco with his wife Tracy and his dog, Charlie.</p>

                                    Teams are at most 4 people. You can select teammates when you register, or you can register individually without specified teammates. We’ll run the lottery by teams, so rest assured you’ll be able to hack with your friends if that’s what you prefer!

                                    We created factions to encourage hackers to have fun and interact with each other outside of normal teams when you’re not working on your projects.  The Red Faction and Blue Faction are hackathon-wide groups  that collectively complete challenges at HackMIT 2017 for points.  The faction with the most points will win and get a surprise upon the conclusion of the hackathon.
